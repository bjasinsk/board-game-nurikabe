# Board Game Nurikabe

Repository for a university group project. The aim of the project is to create a working Nurikabe puzzle game. Project members: Karol Babik, Bartosz Jasi≈Ñski, Jakub Skorupa, Aleksandra Rostkowska

After starting the programme, the user can generate a new random board via the user interface or load a ready board from a specified file. The board is then displayed on the screen and the player can make moves. At any time during the game, the user can save the game state to a file, or load a previously saved saved game state. The player also has the option to export the board to a PNG file. When the player has finished solving Nurikabe uses the Send Solution button and the programme checks the correctness of the solution and verifies the answer, informing the player of any errors.
